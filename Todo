Roles in development:
    - Tracker: Deactivate the arrow when the Tracker dies
    - Snitch: Deactivate the arrows (if ever active) if the Snitch dies, Snitch ImportantTaskText counts as an uncompleted task with the current computation -> fix that because otherwise role descriptions might count as tasks as well
    - Vampire: Garlic layer (same for footsteps), The VampireTryKill always calls the handleMurderAttempt locally (in order to be able to kill right before meetings), this can lead to issues with delays. We should add a prefix for the ReportPlayer call of the lobby host,
    that does that check and then sends a definite kill call to all the other players (before he sends the openMeeting call).

    - Jackal:
        - Lover Jackal with Crew Lover should be a Lovers solo win
        - Should the Jackal be able to target players in vents
        - Lover Sidekick being promoted removes the Lover ImportantTaskText and highlights the name in the Lover color (maybe change how Lovers are being displayed)
        - SidekickPromotes RPC call is called by every player

High priority:
    - Jester/Bounty Hunter: Check which use multiple RPC calls. Either do all checks locally or send only one RPC call (Watch out for the RPC call being sent to late and hence another "wrong" win condition ending the game)

Medium priority:
    - Morphling add small cooldown (0.5s) after sampling
    - Promoting a Vampire to be the Sidekick, stops the last bitten target to die (as Vampire.vampire and Vampire.bitten are set to null)
    - Medic shield rework
    - On Lovers win with JackalLover, it says Lovers and Crewmate win (maybe count that as a Lovers solo win)
    - Crowded mod
    - Vent outline for/"against" Jackal team
    - Refactor Vampire sprite update code (move it)
    - Add option: Vampire can kill in garlic range
    - CustomButton: Add hotkeys (for the ones that replace the kill button)
    - Bounty Hunter: Should the Seer reveal him as a good or as a bad player?
    - Add option: On camouflage/morphed hide/adapt Seer/Detective/Child/maybe shield 
    - Garlic and footprints renderering/gameobject layer (they are not visible on the ramp/in the comms room/in the weapons room on Polus)
    - Morphling: Add a short cooldown after sampling to prevent a "double click"
    - Spawn system: Include Lovers in the default ticket system (This might not be relevant anymore after the Lovers "rework")
    - Move code where it's possible from the HudManager.Update to the PlayerControl.FixedUpdate
    - Custom Settings: On some screen resolutions it glitches out of the screen, add a spacer option
    - Add proper GameOverReasons


Low priority:
    - Sheriff: Change option "Sheriff can kill the Jester" to "Sheriff can kill neutrals.
    - Lovers: Chat
    - Swapper: Handle the problem where a really late swap causes only some players to swap and hence might cause different exiled players for some of the clients (because of the RPC delay)
    - Sheriff: Both die option
    - Mafioso/Janitor: Set UseButtonImage instead of leaving the sabotage image (when they are unable to use the sabotage)
    - Mayor: Maybe let him vote two times instead of voting ones with two votes
    - Morphling + Camouflager: Duration option
    - TimeMaster: Rewinding and vents are still not perfect
    - Medic: Check shield break code should maybe be moved to a more logical location
    - Dead pets are being revived by the Camouflager (but they're only visible to the dead players as they are on another layer)
    - Swapper: Light/Comms should not just close when opening them (but one can't delete the tasks, as the comms task is needed to e.g. block the camera) light/comms
