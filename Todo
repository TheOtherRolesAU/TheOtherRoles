Roles in development:
    - Vampire: Garlic layer (same for footsteps)
    - Jackal:
        - Lover Jackal with Crew Lover should be a Lovers solo win
        - Should the Jackal be able to target players in vents
        - Lover Sidekick being promoted removes the Lover ImportantTaskText and highlights the name in the Lover color (maybe change how Lovers are being displayed)
        - SidekickPromotes RPC call is called by every player
        - Jackal/Vent/Impostor vent highlighting
    - Shifter and Eraser: Fake tasks for neutral roles, which will be activated on Shift/Erase
    - Spy: As a morphed Morphling keeps his Red name, the other Impostor can see that he's not a Spy

High priority:
    - Reintroduce the BountyHunter role, as it was somehow requested multiple times during the last few days
    - Jackal promotion trigger should work on Jackal DC (same for Mafioso)
    - RoleDescription (ImportantTaskText) updates should not be called from FixedUpdate
    - Jester/Bounty Hunter/Child: Check which use multiple RPC calls. Either do all checks locally or send only one RPC call (Watch out for the RPC call being sent to late and hence another "wrong" win condition ending the game)

Medium priority:
    - Host/Client Skip/Tie message
    - Promoting a Vampire to be the Sidekick, saves the last bitten target right now (as Vampire.vampire and Vampire.bitten are set to null)
    - Vent outline for/"against" Jackal team
    - Refactor Vampire sprite update code (move it)
    - Move code where it's possible from the HudManager.Update to the PlayerControl.FixedUpdate

Low priority:
    - Lovers: Chat
    - Sheriff: Both die option
    - Swapper: Light/Comms should not just close when opening them (but one can't delete the tasks, as the comms task is needed to e.g. block the camera) light/comms

Role/implementation community ideas:
    - Roles scrambler
    - Camouflage comms
    - Mind control
    - Dummy spawner character
    - Impostors don't know each other and can kill each other
    - Medic -> Guardian
    - Night vision camera
    - Glitch
    - Necromancy
    - Vent digger/Camera placer
    - Cameleon
    - Invisibility imp/crew
    - Character that can walk through walls for a second
