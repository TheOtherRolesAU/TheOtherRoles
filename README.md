\
**Changes in v1.5:**
- Time Master - Buff: He is not affected by his rewind anymore, which gives him more utility. Players will now be rewinded out of vents.
- Child - Nerf: The Child now grows up (see [Child](#child)) and becomes a normal Crewmate at some point. A growing Child is not killable anymore. Some tasks are still not doable for the small Child, we are working on that. But eventually when growing up it can do all the tasks as it's size increases.
- Seer - Nerf: Added an option that sets how often the Seer mistakes the player for another.
- Hacker - Nerf: The Hacker now only sees the additional information when he activates his "Hacker mode". That should stops the Hacker from camping the admin table/vitals.

**Changes in v1.4:**

# Custom Servers and 10+ Players
We always recommend you to play on custom servers rather than on the official ones. If you want to play with more than 10 players in one lobby, you're required to use a custom server. Credits for the original implementation that allowed 10+ player lobbies go to the creaters of the [Crowded-Mod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod).

**Setup the Clients:**
1. Open the region menu where you can choose between the different regions
2. Select the region *Custom*
3. Enter the ip/domain and the port of your custom server in the corresponding text fields

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) release for the Among Us version **2021.3.31 - 2021.4.2**
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official [Impostor-Documentation](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the *config.json* file:
```
    ...
    "AntiCheat": {
      "Enabled": false,
      "BanIpFromGame": false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine
5. Run the server and setup the client

**Setting up Server as Docker Container:** \
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
```
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```
(Currently only the "nightly" tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)

In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
```
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false
```

Example to docker run command:
```
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

Or use to run it in the background
```
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

# Settings
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):
- **Streamer Mode:** You can activate the streamer mode in the Among Us settings. It hides the lobby code, the custom server ip and the custom server port. You can set a custom lobby code replacement text, by changing the *Streamer Mode Replacement Text* in the *BepInEx\config\me.eisbison.theotherroles.cfg* file.
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor count be set inside a lobby
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left, Impostor and Jackal meetings also count) 
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, he'll vote himself.
- **Hide Player Names:** Hides the names of all players that have role which is unknown to you. Team Lovers/Impostors/Jackal still see the names of their teammates. Impostors can alse see the name of the Spy and everyone can still see the age of the child.
- **Ghosts Can See Roles And Remaining Tasks:** If set to true, ghosts can see the role and the number of remaining tasks of each player.

# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding *_parametername* to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname_back.png*.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when he's climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname_climb.png*.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the *\TheOtherHats\Test* subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# Roles

## Role Assignment
We are still improving the role assignment system. It's not that intuitive right now, but it's more flexible than the older one
if you're using it right.

First you need to choose how many special roles you want in the game (one option for Impostor roles and one option for the rest).
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (one pool for Impostors, one for Crewmates). Then the roles will be selected randomly from that pool as long as possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill nor sabotage until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill nor sabotage, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 Impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Mafia Spawn Chance | -
| Janitor Cooldown | -
-----------------------

## Morphling
### **Team: Impostors**
The Morphling is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player. After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for 10s.
\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the Child when they copies its look.
- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator)
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Morphling Spawn Chance | -
| Morphling Cooldown | -
| Morph Duration | Time the Morphling stays morphed
-----------------------

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an Impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode.
The camouflage mode lasts for 10s and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats
are hidden and all players have the same color.\
\
**NOTE**
- The Child will look like all the other players
- The color of the footprints turns gray (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The Hacker sees gray icons on the admin table
- The shield is not visible anymore
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Camouflager Spawn Chance | -
| Camouflager Cooldown | -
| Camo Duration | Time players stay camouflaged
-----------------------

## Vampire
### **Team: Impostors**
The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, he dies at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).
- If there is a Vampire in the game, there can't be a Warlock

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Vampire Spawn Chance | -
| Vampire Kill Delay | -
| Vampire Cooldown | Sets the kill/bite cooldown
| Vampire Can Kill Near Garlics | The Vampire can never bite when his victim is near a garlic. If this option is set to true, he can still perform a normal kill there.
-----------------------

## Eraser
### **Team: Impostors**
The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or his target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors. Depending on the options
he can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- Erasing a Lover automatically erases the other Lover as well (if the second Lover is an ImpLover, he will turn into an Impostor)
- Erasing a Jackal that has a Sidekick, triggers the Sidekick promotion if it's activated in the settings
- As the erasing is being triggered before the eject of a player, erasing and voting out a Lover in the same round, would result in the
ex Lover surviving as the partnership was erased before. Also a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Eraser Spawn Chance | -
| Eraser Cooldown | The Erasers cooldown will increase by 10 seconds after every erase.
| Eraser Can Erase Anyone | If set to false, he can't erase the Spy and other Impostors
-----------------------

## Trickster
### **Team: Impostors**
The Trickster is an Impostor that can place 3 jack-in-the-boxes that are invisible at first to other players. \
If the Trickster has placed all of his boxes they will be converted into a vent network usable only by the Trickster himself, but the boxes are revealed to the others. \
If the boxes are converted to a vent network, the Trickster gains a new ability "Lights out" to limit the visibility of Non-Impostors, that cannot be fixed by other players. Lights are automatically restored after a while. \

\
**NOTE:**
- Impostors will get a text indicator at the bottom of the screen to notify them if the lights are out due to the Trickster ability, as there is no sabotage arrows or task to sabotage text to otherwise notify them about it.

## Warlock
### **Team: Impostors**
The Warlock is an Impostor, that can curse another player (the cursed player doesn't get notified).\
If the cursed person stands next to another player, the Warlock is able to kill that player (no matter how far away he is).\
Performing a kill with the help of a cursed player, will lift the curse and it will result in the Warlock being unable to move for a configurable amount of time.
The Warlock can still perform normal kills, but the two buttons share the same cooldown.

\
**NOTE:**
- The Warlock can always kill his Impostor mates (and even himselfs) using the "cursed kill"
- If there is a Warlock in the game, there can't be a Vampire

## Lovers
### **Team: Either Crewmates or Impostors**
There are always two Lovers which are linked together.\
Their goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game.\
If one Lover dies (and the option is activated), the other Lover suicides.\
You can specify the chance of one Lover being an Impostor.\
The Lovers never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is.\
The Lovers win if they are both alive among the last 3 players, however they can also win with their respective role.\
If both Lovers are Crewmates, they can achieve a "double victory" but the Crewmates then also win.\
If one Lover is an Impostor and one a Crewmate, they can only get a "Lovers solo win" where only they win (even if there is another Impostor alive).\
\
**NOTE:**
- If there is an equal amount of Impostors and Crewmates left in the game and one of the Lovers is an Impostor, the game is not automatically over since the Lovers can still achieve a solo win. E.g. if there are the following roles Impostor + ImpLover + Lover + Crewmate left, the game will not end and the next kill will decide if the Impostors or Lovers win.
- The Lovers can change if the Shifter takes the role of a Lovers

Because of the vents the Engineer might not be able to start some tasks using the "Use" button,
you can double click on the tasks instead.
\

The Child cannot be killed until it turns 18 years old, however it can be voted out.\
**Impostor Child:**
  - While growing up the kill cooldown is doubled. When it's fully grown up its kill cooldown is 2/3 of the default one.
  - If it gets thrown out of the ship, everything is fine.

**Crewmate Child:**

  - If it gets thrown out of the ship before it turns 18, everyone loses. So think twice before you vote out a Child.

**NOTE:**
- Impostors can't kill the Child (the button does not work) until it turns 18
- The Sheriff can kill the Impostor Child, but only if it's fully grown up

## Shifter
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Shifter can take over the role of another Crewmate or Neutral, the other player will transform into a Crewmate.\
The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\
Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\
Swapping roles with a Crewmate or Neutral gives them their role, the other player becomes a Crewmate.\
Swapping roles with an Impostor or a custom Impostor role fails and the Shifter commits suicide after the next meeting (there won't be any body).\
The Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or Medic that is known to the Impostors.\
This works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possiblity to act like a Shifter.\
The **special interactions** with the Shifter are noted in the chapters of the respective roles.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- If the Shifter takes over a role, their new cooldowns will start at the maximum cooldown of the ability
- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or Engineer sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the Shifter
can only use them, if the previous player did not used them before)

## Time Master
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Time Master has a time shield which he can activate. The time shield remains active for a configurable amount of time.\
If a player trys to kill the Time Master while the time shield is active, the kill won't happen and the 
time will rewind for a set amount of time.\
The kill cooldown of the killer won't be reset, so the Time Master
has to make sure that the game won't result in the same situation.\
The Time Master won't be affected by the rewind.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Only the movement is affected by the rewind
- A Vampire bite will trigger the rewind. If the Time Master misses shielding the bite, he can still shield the kill which happens a few seconds later.
- If the Time Master was bitten and has his shield active before when a meeting is called, he survives but the time won't be rewinded.
- If the Time Master has a Medic shield, he won't rewind.
- The shield itself ends immediately when triggered. So the timemaster can be attacked again as soon as the rewind ends.

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be his Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds him to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses his current role (except if he's a Lover, then he plays in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be his Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or he will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal an remain as he was.\
\
The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (the Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Child lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
4. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
5. Lovers among the last three players win
6. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
7. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
8. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostrs left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and his Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Child, while it's growing up. After that he can kill it or select it as its Sidekick
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (that's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.

-----------------------

## Sidekick
### **Team: Jackal**
Gets assigned to a player during the game by the "Create Sidekick Action" of the Jackal and joins the Jackal in his quest to eliminate all other players.\
Upon the death of the Jackal (depending on the options), he might get promoted to Jackal himself and potentially even assign a Sidekick of his own.
\
**NOTE:**

-----------------------

## Spy
### **Team: Crewmates**

The Spy looks like an additional Impostor to the Impostors, they can't tell the difference.\
There are two possibilities (depending on the set options):
- The Impostors can't kill the Spy (because otherwise their kill button would reveal, who the Spy is)
- The Impostors can kill the Spy but they can also kill their Impostor partner (if they mistake another Impostor for the Spy)
You can set whether the Sheriff can kill the Spy or not (in order to keep the lie alive).
