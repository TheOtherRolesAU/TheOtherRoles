- Add Witch option "Voting The Witch Saves All The Targets"
- Add Lawyer option "Lawyer Knows Target Role"

- Bug fix: The Medium now shows the roles of players in the right format
- The name and the role of all winners is now being displayed on the end screen
- We changed the way settings are being shared among the players (which caused some people to be unable to join the lobby). This might resolve the problem or make it even worse... we'll see.

**Version 3.2.1**
- Hotfix for 3.2.0
- Bug fix: The Warlock is again able to kill with the curse abilty

**Version 3.2.0**
- **New Role:** [Witch](#witch) created by [Alex2911](https://github.com/Alex2911)
- **New Role:** [Lawyer](#lawyer)
- Bug fix: Choosing an Impostor as a Sidekick won't resulted in an Impostor/Sidekick mix anymore.
- Bug fix: The Guesser info now shows the right information, when the Guesser guesses the wrong role and kills himself.
- Bug fix: Hats are being displayed in alphabetic order. Hats demo in freeplay is working again. Fixed a bug where hats would not load when accessed from the main menu.
- Bug fix: The Detective now shows the name of the players in any case.

**Hotfix 3.1.2**
- Don't ask, just update. I messed up.

**Hotfix 3.1.1**
- Bug fix: You're again able to connect to custom servers
- Bug fix: The option "Guesses Visible In Ghost Chat" doesn't result in a ban of the Guesser anymore
- Bug fix: The position of the Spy on the intro screen is again random
- Bug fix: Re-added some venting rules that were lost (Spy can't move between vents, only Trickster can use boxes, ...)

**Version 3.1.0**
- Hopefully temporary fixing the issue of being kicked by Innersloth servers for regular kills, until Innersloth fixes it on their side.
- **NOTE:** Do not combine modded and unmodded versions of the game (even if you don't activate anything). Because of the kicking fix, your kills won't be performed for players that do not share the exact same modded version. Due to this you now can't start a game as the host, if not everyone in the lobby has the same version of the mod. Additionally you'll be kicked out of a lobby after 10 seconds, if the host doesn't have the mod installed (or the same mod version).
- **Tracker:** The Tracker has been reworked by [Alex2911](https://github.com/Alex2911). The Tracker now has an additional optional ability that tracks all corpses on the map for a few seconds.
- Add new option: Allow Parallel MedBay Scans
- Add new [Guesser](#guesser) option: "Guesses Visible In Ghost Chat"
- Add new [Guesser](#guesser) option: "Guesses Ignore The Medic Shield". If this option is set to false, no matter what the Guesser guessed, no one will die and the shielded player/Medic might be notified
- Add new [Medic](#medic) option: "Medic Sees Murder Attempt On Shielded Player". This includes attempts from any kind of killer (Sheriff, Jackal, Guesser if the shield is not being ignored, ...)
- During meetings the [Detective](#detective), [Hacker](#hacker) and [Medium](#medium) now display, whether a player wears a darker or lighter color
- Bug fix: Bounty Hunter, Mini and Engineer in vent kills do not result in players being kicked anymore
- Bug fix: The Trickster vent button now doesn't show the text "vent" twice anymore
- Bug fix: Fixed the visual bug where both Lovers always showed dead during the meeting after a correct guess of one of them even if the option "Both Lovers Die" was disabled

**Version 3.0.0**
- Updated to Among Us version v2021.11.9.5s
- **Note:** We wanted to update as fast as possible, that's why you can't use both the Innersloth and mod roles at the same time. We'll make that possible in the future, but there are various things that need to be modified (e.g. Shifter, Guesser, ...) to make that work, so that'll take a little longer. Also, be aware that this version might contain more bugs than usual because Innersloth changed a lot of things and we might have missed some of them.
- Ability buttons are now bind to the Q key (if it's a killing ability) or to the F key (otherwise). We'll make the binds adaptable in the future.
- For now we removed the option "Jester Can Sabotage"
- The Sheriff now always dies, when they try to kill a not fully grown Mini

- **New Role:** [Bait](#bait)

\
**Changes in v1.8:**
- **New Roles:** Added the Jackal and Sidekick roles

\
**Changes in v1.5:**
- Time Master - Buff: They are not affected by their rewind anymore, which gives them more utility. Players will now be rewound out of vents.
- Mini - Nerf: The Mini now grows up (see [Mini](#mini)) and becomes a normal Crewmate at some point. A growing Mini is not killable anymore. Some tasks are still not doable for the small Mini, we are working on that. But eventually when growing up it can do all the tasks as it's size increases.
- Seer - Nerf: Added an option that sets how often the Seer mistakes the player for another.
- Hacker - Nerf: The Hacker now only sees the additional information when they activate their "Hacker mode". That should stop the Hacker from camping the admin table/vitals.
- Other: Camouflager/Morphling cooldowns were fixed. Custom regions code was removed to enable 3rd party tools. Some minor bugfixes.

**Changes in v1.4:**
- Fixing a Camouflager/Morphling animation bug

4. Launch the game via Steam

# Custom Servers and 10+ Players
We always recommend you to play on custom servers rather than on the official ones. If you want to play with more than 10 players in one lobby, you're required to use a custom server. Credits for the original implementation that allowed 10+ player lobbies go to the creators of the [CrowdedMod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod).

**Setup the Clients:**
1. Open the region menu where you can choose between the different regions
2. Select the region *Custom*
3. Enter the ip/domain and the port of your custom server in the corresponding text fields

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) release for the Among Us version **2021.3.31 - 2021.4.2**
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official [Impostor-Documentation](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the `config.json` file:
```
    ...
    "AntiCheat": {
      "Enabled": false,
      "BanIpFromGame": false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine
5. Run the server and setup the client

**Setting up Server as Docker Container:** \
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
```
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```
(Currently only the "nightly" tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)

In addition to running it, the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature need to be set.
```
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false
```

Example to docker run command:
```
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

Or use to run it in the background
```
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

# Settings
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):
- **Streamer Mode:** You can activate the streamer mode in the Among Us settings. It hides the lobby code, the custom server ip and the custom server port. You can set a custom lobby code replacement text, by changing the *Streamer Mode Replacement Text* in the `BepInEx\config\me.eisbison.theotherroles.cfg` file.
- **Number of Crewmates:** The number of Crewmate roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Neutrals:** The number of Neutral roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Modifiers:** The number of Modifiers can be set inside a lobby.
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby.
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (Every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left. Impostor and Jackal meetings also count).
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, they'll vote themself.
- **Hide Player Names:** Hides the names of all players that have role which is unknown to you. Team Lovers/Impostors/Jackal still see the names of their teammates. Impostors can also see the name of the Spy and everyone can still see the age of the mini.
- **Allow Parallel MedBay Scans:** Allows players to perform their MedBay scans at the same time.
- **Shield Last Game First Kill** The first killed player of the previous round will be shielded for all players visible until the first meeting.
- **Play On A Random Map** If enabled it allows you to set a rotation of all current maps, except ehT dlekS 
- **Ghosts Can See Roles**
- **Ghosts Can See Votes**
- **Ghosts Can See The Number Of Remaining Tasks**
- **The map is accessable during a meeting and will show your last location when a body gets reported/meeting gets called**
- **Task Counts:** You are now able to select more tasks.
- **Role Summary:** When a game ends there will be a list of all players and their roles and their task progress
- **Darker/Lighter:** Displays color type of each player in meetings

### Task Count Limits per map
You can configure:
- Up to 4 common tasks
- Up to 23 short tasks
- Up to 15 long tasks

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.

| Map | Common Tasks | Short Tasks | Long Tasks |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Skeld / Dleks | 2 | 19 | 8
| Mira HQ | 2 | 13 | 11
| Polus | 4 | 14 | 15
| Airship | 2 | 23 | 15
-----------------------


# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# Roles

## Role Assignment
We are still improving the role assignment system. It's not that intuitive right now, but it's more flexible than the older one
if you're using it right.

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Mafia, Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 Impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Mafia Spawn Chance | -
| Janitor Cooldown | -
-----------------------

## Morphling
### **Team: Impostors**
The Morphling is an Impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player. After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for 10s.\
\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the Mini when they copy its look.
- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator).
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Morphling Spawn Chance | -
| Morphling Cooldown | -
| Morph Duration | Time the Morphling stays morphed
-----------------------

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an Impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode.\
The camouflage mode lasts for 10s and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats\
are hidden and all players have the same color.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Mini will look like all the other players
- The color of the footprints turns gray (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The Hacker sees gray icons on the admin table
- The shield is not visible anymore
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Camouflager Spawn Chance | -
| Camouflager Cooldown | -
| Camo Duration | Time players stay camouflaged
-----------------------

## Vampire
### **Team: Impostors**
The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, they die at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).
- If there is a Vampire in the game, there can't be a Warlock.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Vampire Spawn Chance | -

## Eraser
### **Team: Impostors**
The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or their target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors.\
Depending on the options they can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of their target, depending on whom the Eraser erased)
- Erasing a Lover automatically erases the other Lover as well (if the second Lover is an ImpLover, they will turn into an Impostor)
- Erasing a Jackal that has a Sidekick, triggers the Sidekick promotion if it's activated in the settings
- As the erase is being triggered before the ejection of a player, erasing and voting out a Lover in the same round, would result in the
ex-Lover surviving, as the partnership was erased before. Also a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.

If the boxes are converted to a vent network, the Trickster gains a new ability "Lights out" to limit the visibility of Non-Impostors, that cannot be fixed by other players. Lights are automatically restored after a while.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Impostors will get a text indicator at the bottom of the screen to notify them if the lights are out due to the Trickster ability, as there is no sabotage arrows or task to sabotage text to otherwise notify them about it.

This can result in players being marked as spelled during the meeting, but not dying in the end (when they get a shield or the Witch gets blanked after they were spelled by the Witch).\
If the Witch dies before the meeting starts or if the Witch is being guessed during the meeting, the spellbound players will be highlighted but they'll survive in any case.\
Depending on the options you can choose whether voting the Witch out will save all the spellbound players or not.\

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be their Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds them to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal and remain as they were.\
Also if a Spy or Impostor gets sidekicked, they still will appear red to the Impostors.

The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. Lovers among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostors left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and their Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Mini, while it's growing up. After that they can kill it or select it as its Sidekick.
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew.)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game, the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.

\
How the Lawyer wins:

- If their client is Jester and the Jester gets voted out, the Lawyer wins together with the Jester.

**NOTE:**

## Pursuer
### **Team: Neutral**
The Pursuer is still a neutral role, but has a different goal to win the game; they have to be alive when the game ends and the Crew wins.\
In order to achieve this goal, the Pursuer has an ability called "Blank", where they can fill a killers (this also includes the Sheriff) weapon with a blank. So, if the killer attempts to kill someone, the killer will miss their target, and their cooldowns will be triggered as usual.\
If the killer fires the "Blank", shields (e.g. Medic shield or Time Master shield) will not be triggered.\
The Pursuer has tasks (which can already be done while being a Lawyer), that count towards the task win for the Crewmates. If the Pursuer dies, their tasks won't be counted anymore.

-----------------------

## Shifter
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Shifter can take over the role of another Crewmate, the other player will transform into a Crewmate.\
The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\
Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\
Swapping roles with an Impostor or Neutral fails and the Shifter commits suicide after the next meeting (there won't be any body).\
The Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or Medic that is known to the Impostors.\
This works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possibility to act like a Shifter.\
The **special interactions** with the Shifter are noted in the chapters of the respective roles.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of their target, depending on whom the Eraser erased)
- If the Shifter takes over a role, their new cooldowns will start at the maximum cooldown of the ability
- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or Engineer sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the Shifter
can only use them, if the previous player did not use them before)

Because of the vents the Engineer might not be able to start some tasks using the "Use" button, you can double-click on the tasks instead.

## Lovers

There are always two Lovers which are linked together.\
Their primary goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game.\
If one Lover dies (and the option is activated), the other Lover suicides.\
You can specify the chance of one Lover being an Impostor.\
The Lovers never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is.\
The Lovers win, if they are both alive when the game ends. They can also win with their original team (e.g. a dead Impostor Lover can win with the Impostors, an Arsonist Lover can still achieve an Arsonist win).\
If one of the Lovers is a killer (i.e. Jackal/Sidekick/Impostor), they can achieve a "Lovers solo win" where only the Lovers win.\
If there is no killer among the Lovers (e.g. an Arsonist Lover + Crewmate Lover) and they are both alive when the game ends, they win together with the Crewmates.\
If there's an Impostor/Jackal + Crewmate Lover in the game, the tasks of a Crewmate Lover won't be counted (for a task win) as long as they're alive.\
If the Lover dies, their tasks will also be counted.\
You can enable an exclusive chat only for Lovers.

**NOTE:**
In a 2 Crewmates vs 2 Impostors (or 2 members of team Jackal) and the Lovers are not in the same team, the game is not automatically over since the Lovers can still achieve a solo win. E.g. if there are the following roles Impostor + ImpLover + Lover + Crewmate left, the game will not end and the next kill will decide if the Impostors or Lovers win.

The Mini's character is smaller and hence visible to everyone in the game.\
The Mini cannot be killed until it turns 18 years old, however it can be voted out.

**Impostor/Jackal Mini:**
- While growing up the kill cooldown is doubled. When it's fully grown up its kill cooldown is 2/3 of the default one.
- If it gets thrown out of the ship, everything is fine.

**Crewmate Mini:**
- The Crewmate Mini aims to play out the strength its invincibility in the early game.
- If it gets thrown out of the ship before it turns 18, everyone loses. So think twice before you vote out a Mini.

**Neutral Mini:**
- The cooldown is not effected, except for the Team Jackal/Sidekick.
- If it gets thrown out of the ship, everything is fine except for the Jester.
- If the Jester Mini gets voted out the game will end in a Jester win.
