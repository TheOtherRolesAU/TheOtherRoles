- Add map and impostor count to lobby settings.
- Fixed bugs where changing players to be the Sidekick didn't reset all the effects of their previous role. 

**Hotfix 1.8.1** Resolves bugs that occured when the Jackal recruited a Medic, Swapper and Tracker\
\

\
**Changes in v1.5:**
- Time Master - Buff: He is not affected by his rewind anymore, which gives him more utility. Players will now be rewinded out of vents.
- Child - Nerf: The child now grows up (see [child](#child)) and becomes a normal crewmate at some point. A growing child is not killable anymore. Some tasks are still not doable for the small child, we are working on that. But eventually when growing up it can do all the tasks as it's size increases.
- Seer - Nerf: Added an option that sets how often the Seer mistakes the player for another.
- Hacker - Nerf: The Hacker now only sees the additional information when he activates his "Hacker mode". That should stops the hacker from camping the admin table/vitals.
- Other: Camouflager/Morphling cooldowns were fixed. Custom regions code was removed to enable 3rd party tools. Some minor bugfixes.

**Changes in v1.4:**
- Fixing a Camoflager/Morphling animation bug

- The custom cooldown buttons now render the cooldown progress (the grey overlay) in the right way (v1.3 introduced the bug)

# Custom Servers and 10+ Players
We always recommend you to play on custom servers rather than on the official ones. If you want to play with more than 10 players in one lobby, you're required to use a custom server. Credits for the original implementation that allowed 10+ player lobbies go to the creaters of the [Crowded-Mod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod).

**Setup the Clients:**
1. Run the game one time after you installed TheOtherRoles to generate the config files
2. Open the Among Us folder (or the folder containing the TheOtherRoles mod), go to the subfolder BepInEx/config/ and replace the *Custom Server IP* and *Custom Server Port* in the **me.eisbison.theotherroles.cfg** with the ones of your server
3. Launch the game and select the region *Custom*

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) release for the Among Us version **2021.3.31 - 2021.4.2**
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official [Impostor-Documentation](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the *config.json* file:
```
    ...
    "AntiCheat": {
      "Enabled": false,
      "BanIpFromGame": false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine
5. Run the server and setup the client

**Setting up Server as Docker Container:** \
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
```
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```
(Currently only the "nightly" tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)

In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
```
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false
```

Example to docker run command:
```
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

Or use to run it in the background
```
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

# Settings
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor count be set inside a lobby
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left, Impostor and Jackal meetings also count) 
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, he'll vote himself.
# Roles

## Role Assignment
We are still improving the role assignment system. It's not that intuitive right now, but it's more flexible than the older one
if you're using it right.

First you need to choose how many special roles you want in the game (one option for Impostor roles and one option for the rest).
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (one pool for Impostors, one for Crewmates). Then the roles will be selected randomly from that pool as long as possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more crewmates or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an impostor who cannot kill nor sabotage until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an impostor who cannot kill nor sabotage, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Mafia Spawn Chance | -
| Janitor Cooldown | -
-----------------------

## Morphling
### **Team: Impostors**
The Morphling is an impostor which can additionally scan the appearance of a player. After an arbitrary time they can take on that appearance for 10s.
\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the child when they copies its look.
- The Spy sees their new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other impostor still sees that they are an impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator)
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Morphling Spawn Chance | -
| Morphling Cooldown | -
-----------------------

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode.
The camouflage mode lasts for 10s and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats
are hidden and all players have the same color.\
\
**NOTE**
- The Child will look like all the other players
- The color of the footprints turns gray (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The Spy sees gray icons on the admin table
- The shield is not visible anymore
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Camouflager Spawn Chance | -
| Camouflager Cooldown | -
-----------------------

## Vampire
### **Team: Impostors**
The Vampire is an impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, he dies at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Vampire Spawn Chance | -
| Vampire Kill Delay | -
| Vampire Cooldown | Sets the kill/bite cooldown
| Vampire Can Kill Near Garlics | The Vampire can never bite when his victim is near a garlic. If this option is set to true, he can still perform a normal kill there.
-----------------------

## Eraser
### **Team: Impostors**
The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or his target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors. Depending on the options
he can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- Erasing a Lover automatically erases the other Lover as well (if the second Lover is an ImpLover, he will turn into an Impostor)
- Erasing a Jackal that has a Sidekick, triggers the Sidekick promotion if it's activated in the settings
- As the erasing is being triggered before the eject of a player, erasing and voting out a Lover in the same round, would result in the
ex lover surviving as the partnership was erased before. Also a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Eraser Spawn Chance | -
| Eraser Cooldown | The Erasers cooldown will increase by 10 seconds after every erase.
| Eraser Can Erase Anyone | If set to false, he can't erase the Spy and other Impostors
-----------------------

## Trickster
### **Team: Impostors**
The Trickster is an Impostor that can place 3 jack-in-the-boxes that are invisible at first to other players. \
If the Trickster has placed all of his boxes they will be converted into a vent network usable only by the trickster himself, but the boxes are revealed to the others. \
If the boxes are converted to a vent network, the trickster gains a new ability "Lights out" to limit the visibility of Non-Impostors, that cannot be fixed by other players. Lights are automatically restored after a while. \

\
**NOTE:**
- Impostors will get a text indicator at the bottom of the screen to notify them if the lights are out due to the trickster ability, as there is no sabotage arrows or task to sabotage text to otherwise notify them about it.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Trickster Spawn Chance | -
| Trickster Box Cooldown | Cooldown for placing jack-in-the-boxes
| Trickster Lights Out Cooldown | Cooldown for his "lights out" ability
| Trickster Lights Out Duration | Duration after which the light is automatically restored
-----------------------

## Lovers
### **Team: Either Crewmates or Impostors**
There are always two lovers which are linked together.\
Their goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game.\
If one Lover dies (and the option is activated), the other Lover suicides.\
You can specify the chance of one Lover being an impostor.\
The Lovers never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is.\
The Lovers win if they are both alive among the last 3 players, however they can also win with their respective role.\
If both Lovers are crewmates, they can achieve a "double victory" but the crewmates then also win.\
If one Lover is an impostor and one a crewmate, they can only get a "Lovers solo win" where only they win (even if there is another impostor alive).\
\
**NOTE:**
- If there is an equal amount of impostors and crewmates left in the game and one of the Lovers is an impostor, the game is not automatically over since the Lovers can still achieve a solo win. E.g. if there are the following roles Impostor + ImpLover + Lover + Crewmate left, the game will not end and the next kill will decide if the impostors or Lovers win.
- The Lovers can change if the Shifter takes the role of a Lovers

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Lovers Spawn Chance | -
| Chance That One Lover Is Impostor | -
| Both Lovers Die | Whether the second Lover suicides, if the first one dies
-----------------------


## Sheriff
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Sheriff has the ability to kill impostors.
If they try to kill a crewmate, they die instead.

**NOTE**
- If the Sheriff shoots the person the Medic shielded, the Sheriff and the shielded person **both remain unharmed**.
- If the Sheriff shoots a Child Impostor, the Sheriff dies if the Child is still growing up. If it's 18, the Child Impostor dies.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Sheriff Spawn Chance | -
| Sheriff Cooldown | -
| Jester Can Die To Sheriff | -
-----------------------

## Jester

## Seer
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Seer has two abilities (one can activate one of them or both in the options).
The Seer sees the souls of players that died a round earlier, the souls slowy fade away.
The Seer gets a blue flash on his screen, if a player dies somewhere on the map.

## Engineer
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Engineer (if alive) can fix one sabotage per game from anywhere on the map.\
The Engineer can use vents. If the Engineer is inside a vent, the impostors will see a blue outline
around all vents on the map (in order to warn them).
Because of the vents the Engineer might not be able to start some tasks using the "Use" button,
you can double click on the tasks instead.
\
**NOTE:**
- The kill button of Impostors activates if they stand next to a vent where the Engineer is. They can also kill them there. No other action (e.g. Morphling sample, Shifter shift, ...) can affect players inside vents.

The Child cannot be killed until it turns 18 years old, however it can be voted out.\
**Impostor Child:**
  - While growing up the kill cooldown is doubled. When it's fully grown up its kill cooldown is 2/3 of the default one.
  - If it gets thrown out of the ship, everything is fine.

**Crewmate Child:**
  - The Crewmate Child aims to play out the strength its invincibility in the early game.
  - If it gets thrown out of the ship before it turns 18, everyone loses. So think twice before you vote out a Child.

- Impostors can't kill the Child (the button does not work) until it turns 18
- The Sheriff can kill the Impostor Child, but only if it's fully grown up

## Medic

The shielded player can still be voted out and might also be an impostor.\
If set in the options, the shielded player will get a red flash on their screen if someone (Impostor, Sheriff, ...) tried to murder them.
If the Medic dies, the shield disappears with them.\
The Sheriff will not die if they try to kill a shielded crewmate and won't perform a kill if they try to kill a shielded impostor.\
The Medic's other feature shows when they report a corpse: they will see how long ago the player died
\

- If the Shifter has a shield or their target has a Shield, the shielded player switches.

Otherwise he sees the same information as everyone else.
**Admin table:** The hacker can see the colors (or color types) of the players on the table.\

## Shifter
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Shifter can take over the role of another Crewmate or Neutral, the other player will transform into a Crewmate.\
The Shift will always be performed at the end of the next meeting right before a player is exiled. The target needs to be chosen during the round.\
Even if the Shifter or the target dies before the meeting, the Shift will still be performed.\
Swapping roles with a Crewmate or Neutral gives them their role, the other player becomes a Crewmate.\
Swapping roles with an impostor or a custom impostor role fails and the Shifter commits suicide (there won't be a body after the meeting).\
The Shifter aims to save roles from leaving the game, by e.g. taking over a Sheriff or Medic that is known to the Impostors.\
This works especially well against the Eraser, but also gives the Eraser the possiblity to act like a Shifter.\
The **special interactions** with the Shifter are noted in the chapters of the respective roles.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of his target, depending on who the Eraser erased)
- If the Shifter takes over a role, their new cooldowns will start at the maximum cooldown of the ability
- One time use abilities (e.g. shielding a player or engineer sabotage fix) can only used by one player in the game (i.e. the Shifter
can only use them, if the previous player did not used them before)

### Game Options

## Time Master
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Time Master has a time shield which he can activate. The time shield remains active for a configurable amount of time.\
If a player trys to kill the Time Master while the time shield is active, the kill won't happen and the 
time will rewind for a set amount of time.\
The kill cooldown of the killer won't be reset, so the Time Master
has to make sure that the game won't result in the same situation.\
The Time Master won't be affected by the rewind.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Only the movement is affected by the rewind
- A Vampire bite will trigger the rewind. If the Time Master misses shielding the bite, he can still shield the kill which happens a few seconds later.
- If the Time Master was bitten and has his shield active before when a meeting is called, he survives but the time won't be rewinded.
- If the Time Master has a Medic shield, he won't rewind.
- The shield itself ends immediately when triggered. So the timemaster can be attacked again as soon as the rewind ends.

| Time Master Spawn Chance | - |

## Swapper
### **Team: Crewmates**
During meetings the Swapper can exchange votes that two people get (i.e. all votes
that player A got will be given to player B and vice versa).\
Because of the Swappers strength in meetings, they might not start emergency meetings
and can't fix lights and comms.

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be his Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds him to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses his current role (except if he's a Lover, then he plays in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be his Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or he will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal an remain as he was.\
\
The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (the Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Child lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
4. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
5. Lovers among the last three players win
6. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
7. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
8. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostrs left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and his Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Child, while it's growing up. After that he can kill it or select it as its Sidekick
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (that's why converting the last crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew)

If both impostors and jackals are in the game the game continues even if all crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.



### Game Options
| Name | Description

-----------------------

## Sidekick
### **Team: Jackal**
Gets assigned to a player during the game by the "Create Sidekick Action" of the Jackal and joins the Jackal in his quest to eliminate all other players.\
Upon the death of the Jackal (depending on the options), he might get promoted to Jackal himself and potentially even assign a Sidekick of his own.
\
**NOTE:**
- A player that converts into a Sidekick loses his previous role and tasks (if he had one), except the lover role.
- The Sidekick may be killed by a Sheriff.
- The Sidekick cannot target the Child, while it's growing up.

-----------------------

## Spy
### **Team: Crewmates**
The Spy is a Crewmate, which has no special abilities.\
The Spy looks like an additional Impostor to the Impostors, they can't tell the difference.\
There are two possibilities (depending on the set options):
- The Impostors can't kill the Spy (because otherwise their kill button would reveal, who the Spy is)
- The Impostors can kill the Spy but they can also kill their Impostor partner (if they mistake another Impostor for the Spy)
You can set whether the Sheriff can kill the Spy or not (in order to keep the lie alive).

### Game Options
| Name | Description
|----------|:-------------:|
| Spy Spawn Chance |
| Spy Can Die To Sheriff | 
| Impostors Can Kill Anyone If There Is A Spy | This allows the Impostors to kill both the Spy and their Impostor partners

It's bad I know, this is a side project and my second week of modding. So there are no best practices around here.
You can use parts of the codes but don't copy paste the whole thing. Make sure you give credits to the other developers, because some parts of the code are based on theirs.
